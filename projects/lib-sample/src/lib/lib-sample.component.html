<h1>Hello, {{name}}</h1>
<h2>The issue is that the following SCSS:</h2>
<code>
  <pre>:host-context(.test-class-01 .test-class-02) &#123;

    &.test-class-03 &#123;
        color: red;
    &#125;

&#125;</pre>
</code>
<br />
<h2>Library Component:</h2>
<p>When the component is in a library that's built separately, the rendered CSS becomes this:</p>
<code>
  <pre>.test-class-01.test-class-02.test-class-03[_nghost-awu-c1],
.test-class-01.test-class-02   .test-class-03[_nghost-awu-c1]</pre>
</code>
<br />
<h2>Non-library Component:</h2>
<p>When the component is either not in a library, or in a library that is not built separately, the rendered CSS becomes this:</p>
<code>
  <pre>.test-class-01[_nghost-yxt-c1]   .test-class-02.test-class-03[_ngcontent-yxt-c1],
.test-class-01   .test-class-02   .test-class-03[_nghost-yxt-c1]</pre>
